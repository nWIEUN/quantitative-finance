the data is from the team's data source which is got from tushare. However, considering the limited qualification, I can only use part of the data, which may cause some mistakes or errors in my results.
tips:
1.pe and pe_ttm are 0 when they are negative.
2.roic is matched by my own, everyone can have a look at my code to get the logic behind the choice of data.
