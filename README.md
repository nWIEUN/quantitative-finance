this package is created for personal exercises about some quantitative-financial projects, which will use python as the main language. my projects will include some machine learning, reinforcement learning but also some basic supervised and unsupervisedlearning models based on real data developed by the team which I've joined, mainly focused on financial engineering.
the main target of this package is to show some skills I've grasped important in q-f field, more like a foundation for my future career.
thanks for watching and always waiting for suggestions！
